# Llava-Cornell-Project
Machine Learning + Citizen Science + Computer Vision

Objective:
Under the guidance of Dr. Bharath Hariharan, our team participated in a summer computer vision and machine learning workshop at Cornell University. The project focused on integrating a large language model called Llava with a specialized recognition model to enhance multimodal capabilities and reduce hallucinations. Our innovative approach was recognized as the most creative project of the summer.

Project Overview:
In this project, we utilized Python and various libraries to modify the Llava model, integrating it with the BioCLIP recognition model to improve its accuracy and reliability. We aimed to address issues related to hallucinations in multimodal language models by combining the strengths of both models.

Challenges:
Integration Complexity: Combining two different models with varying architectures and requirements.
Resource Constraints: Handling large models with limited computational resources.

Results + Impact:
Successfully integrated Llava with BioCLIP, enhancing multimodal language model accuracy and reducing hallucinations.
Recognized for the most creative project of the summer, showcasing innovative solutions in computer vision and accessibility.

Lessons Learned and Future Directions:
Gained experience in integrating complex models and managing large-scale machine learning projects.
Future work could explore further optimizations and applications of multimodal models in different domains.

Reflection + Personal Experience:
Participating in this workshop at Cornell University was an enriching experience, allowing me to work on cutting-edge technology and collaborate with experts in the field. This project solidified my interest in computer vision and machine learning, particularly in how these technologies can be applied to real-world problems.
