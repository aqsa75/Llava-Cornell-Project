# Llava-Cornell-Project
Under the supervision of Dr. Bharath Hariharan, our team embarked on a computer vision project focused on citizen science and accessibility. We utilized Python to modify a large language model called Llava, integrating it with a specialized recognition model to mitigate hallucinations in the multimodal language model.
